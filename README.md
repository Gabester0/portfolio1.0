This is my first proper experience using GIT.  I wanted to make changes to sizing with each example of my work to not include absolute sizes.
I had made tenative attempts at this and it seemed like I was potentially making breaking changes.  So I made the responsive_box_sizing 
branch from the master.  I experimented with the sizing and found a working solution.  I had created a media-queries file and I was going 
to try to address the problem with.   I had copied all the related code with the intention of changing it for specific breakpoints.  

Since letting CSS Grid handle the changes addressed the main concerns I had I deleted the copied code from the queries file.  As I am writing
this I realized that I did have an older version of the Portfolio page that I could have merged withinstead.  Since I was following a git 
guide I didn't think about this and created this new repository.  

If you are interested in seeing the full history of this project I have multiple older versions of this project available on my codepen:
